# Hi, I'm Emmanuel Gyan 👋

I'm a final-year Aerospace Engineering student at KNUST (Ghana) with a strong focus and passion for understanding and interpreting data, data-driven decision making and data analysis. I’m skilled in statistical modeling, optimization and regression analysis in building models that turn operational data into better decisions — validated against real outcomes, with uncertainty quantified.

Currently seeking graduate opportunities in **motorsport strategy engineering**, **aerospace**, **automotive**, and **quantitative analysis** with availability from September 2026.
